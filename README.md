# fix-lync
random small tools to make Microsoft Lync work correctly on my Mac

lync-conf:
a bash script to find the SIP conf URI from a Lync invite HTTP link
e.g. lync-conf https://example.com/meet/user/7ZKR1QKS
I'm sure this has all sorts of assumptions about Lync versions, etc, but it works now so...
